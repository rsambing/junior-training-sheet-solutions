# junior-training-sheet-solutions

This repository contains my personal solutions to the problems from the **Junior Training Sheet V7.0**, created by Dr. Mostafa Saad Ibrahim
The sheet is designed to help beginners in competitive programming improve their problem-solving skills by practicing a structured and progressive set of problems across different plataforms.

## ðŸ“‚ Structure

Each folder in this repository corresponds to a section in sheet (ex: A, B, C1, C2, etc).
Each file contains a solution to a specific problem, with the problem name and link included as comments in the code.

## ðŸš€ Goal
The goal is to gradually solve all problems in the sheet, improve my coding speed and accuracy, and gain experience in solving a wide variety of algorithmic challenges.
